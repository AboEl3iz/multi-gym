# Multi-Gym Management System

## Overview

The Multi-Gym Management System is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the operations of multi-branch fitness centers and gyms. It provides a robust set of tools for administrators, trainers, and members to efficiently manage gym activities, class schedules, bookings, user engagement, and business analyticsâ€”all accessible via a modern dashboard with both branch and global (super admin) insights.

## Project Goals

- **Centralize and automate gym branch management**
- **Enable data-driven decision making via analytics dashboards**
- **Increase user engagement and operational efficiency**
- **Provide a scalable and secure solution for multi-branch gyms**

## Problem Solving Approach

Managing multiple gym branches involves complex challenges such as class scheduling, trainer assignments, booking management, attendance tracking, reporting, and revenue analysis. This project solves these challenges by:

- **Automating scheduling & conflict detection:** Ensures trainers and rooms are never double-booked.
- **Providing real-time analytics:** Dashboards deliver instant insights into membership growth, class popularity, trainer performance, and revenue.
- **Supporting granular access control:** Role-based permissions for SuperAdmin, BranchAdmin, Trainers, and Members.
- **Centralizing communication:** Built-in chat and notification systems.

### 5. **Reporting & Analytics**
- Generate detailed reports (PDF supported) on bookings, attendance, revenue, and more
- Monthly growth and churn analysis

### 6. **Offers & Promotions**
- Define and manage promotional offers and discounts per branch

### 7. **Chat & Notifications**
- Real-time communication between users and admins
- Automated notifications for class updates, bookings, and more

### 8. **API Documentation**
- Interactive Swagger UI available at `/api-docs` for developers and integrators

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** TypeORM (supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)
- **Authentication:** JWT-based
- **Websockets:** Socket.IO for real-time features
- **Documentation:** Swagger (OpenAPI)
- **PDF Reporting:** PDFKit
- **Environment Management:** dotenv

## Database Design

The platform uses a relational database with entities such as:
- **User** (with roles: SuperAdmin, BranchAdmin, Trainer, Member)
- **Branch**
- **Class**
- **Room**
- **Schedule**
- **SessionBooking**
- **Report**
- **Offer**
- **ChatMessage**

TypeORM ensures structured relationships and transactional integrity.
